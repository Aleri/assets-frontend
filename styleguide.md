This Component Library demonstrates styles and components for **HMRC** applications. It is built on top of the [GOV.UK frontend toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) and the [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template) and it uses the [hmrc-component-library-template](https://github.com/hmrc/component-library-template).

## What is the Component Library?
The Component Library is generated output of [HMRC assets-fronted](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend) stylesheets. It allows Designers and Developers to see what components we have across the Tax Platform.

## Adding Components
You can see information about how to add a comment which will enable a component to be rendered in the Component Library by visiting the [HMRC assets-fronted wiki](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/wiki/Component-Library).

## Discussing Changes
We have setup a **Components** collection on [https://hmrcdigital.hackpad.com/collection/EU4v7qZDRel](https://hmrcdigital.hackpad.com/collection/EU4v7qZDRel). Every component page in the Component Library will have a hackpad page of the same name. This will be the place to discuss what you would like for you components.
