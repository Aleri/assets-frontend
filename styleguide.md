This Component Library demonstrates styles and components for **HMRC** applications. It is built on top of the [GOV.UK frontend toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) and the [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template) and it uses the [hmrc-component-library-template](https://github.com/hmrc/component-library-template).

## What is the Component Library?
The Component Library is generated output of [HMRC assets-fronted](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend) stylesheets. 

* It allows Designers and Developers to see what Components we have across our Service
* It provides communication between teams about Components
* It allows teams to stay in sync across the Service
* It avoids duplication of work
* Avoids misunderstandings
* Promotes designing and developing as a Service
* Will create parity across HMRC teams, providing a Service wide design and client side development approach



<a name="why-do-we-need-a-component-library"></a>
## Why do we need a Component Library?
Without a Component Library unless you have extensive knowledge of what is in our stylesheets or know all of our web pages well we have no exposure of what Components we have across HMRC.
* This means an inconsistent interface for users
* Leads to extra design, development and QA work
* Difficult to agree on Components
* Difficult to understand designing/developing as a Service rather than just your designing/developing for your projects needs

## Adding Components
You can see information about how to add a comment which will enable a component to be rendered in the Component Library by visiting the [HMRC assets-fronted wiki](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/wiki/Component-Library).



<a name="discussing-changes"></a>
## Discussing Changes
We have setup a **Components** collection on [https://hmrcdigital.hackpad.com/collection/EU4v7qZDRel](https://hmrcdigital.hackpad.com/collection/EU4v7qZDRel). Every component page in the Component Library will have a hackpad page of the same name. This will be the place to discuss what you would like for you components.

## Reporting Issues / Actioning work - Components
Once a decision has been made by the design team on a component the work needs to be raised and the component needs to be written/changed. To do this please raise an issue in [HMRC assets-fronted issues](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/issues) and attach the `component library` label to it.
